# Stock-price-prediction

I made a stock price prediction model using a univariate stacked LSTM approach. By using  historical 'close' stock prices from Apple's data between 2015 and 2020 available on a library called Tiingo from python, the model learns patterns and uses them to forecast future "close" prices.
